        "comment": "At first I was impressed with the feel & looks...seemed high quality. Then I start using & it misfires like 4 blanks to each staple. I'm using Arrow brand staples too. The misfires started punching holes in my new cover for my Seadoo. It seems like the staples aren't into the trigger mechanism & I read the crappy directions 4x. There is no noticeable spring mechanism from what I could see. Sending it back. "

        "comment": "I've used a few different pinners over the years and this one performs pretty well. I've had trouble using it with melamine cabinets, the pins don't seem to set correctly, or won't even penetrate the surface of the hardened surface. At the same time, I have used it numerous times on hardwoods like oak and cherry with no problems. Decent product for the price.  "

It costs barely more than a manual gun, too. The pneumatic power lets you focus on positioning the staple.  "

Weirdly, the instructions said that the gray one came from the factory and that you need to replace the trigger to get the high-volume configuration. "
